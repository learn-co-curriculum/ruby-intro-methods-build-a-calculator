# Build a Simple Calculator

## Learning Goals

- Use Ruby math operations to build a calculator

## Introduction

Calculators can be very useful devices in day-to-day activities. You've likely
used a calculator to  add up bills for this month or calculate tip at a
restaurant. We're going to take our arithmetic knowledge and put it to the test
by writing functions that will do basic math calculations for us, just like we
can see in IRB.

## Use Ruby Math Operations to Build a Calculator

Fork and clone this repo and open `lib/math.rb`. You'll find a bunch of empty
methods that take numbers as arguments. Build the appropriate behavior for each
of the following methods:
- `addition` - Build the method `addition` that adds `num1` to `num2` and returns the result of this calculation
- `subtraction` - Build the method `subtraction` that subtracts `num1` from
  `num2` and returns the result of this calculation
- `multiplication` - Build the method `multiplication` that multiplies `num1`
  from `num2` and returns the result of this calculation
- `division` - Build the method `division` that divides `num1` into `num2` and returns the result of this calculation
- `modulo` - Build the method `modulo` that divides `num1` into `num2` and gives
  us the _remainder_ of this calculation
- `square_root` -- Build the method `square_root` that finds the square root of
  `num` and returns the result

Submit the lesson once all tests are passing.

## Conclusion

Ruby gives us many operators that can be used to perform calculations. This is
the tip of the iceberg--we can do so much more than simple arithmetic, however,
these operations are the most common that a developer will encounter. Grasping
the basics will get you very far!
